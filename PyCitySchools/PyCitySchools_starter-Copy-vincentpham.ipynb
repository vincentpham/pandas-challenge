    "- In this data set every student in every school has an 100% passing rate in both reading and math regardless of the size of the school or how much each school spend on its students. Even in schools with relatively low overall passing rates around 53%, they still have an 100% passing rate for reading and math. \n",
    "\n",
    "- In each school, the students' math and reading scores generally stay the same throughout the 4 years in high school. There is not much deviation between the scores of each grade in the respective schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In cell 250, you can see that schools with spending ranges per student of $645 to $680 actually has a lower overall passing rate compared to schools with less of a spending range. I wonder why that is? It isn't a crazy assumption to think that schools that have more spending per student would have a higher overall passing rate but in this data set it is actually the opposite. Is it because of the learning culture in these schools? That cannot be quantified.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Larger schools in the 2000 to 5000 category have a relatively low overall passing rate as well with 58.28% comapred to small schools with an 89.89% and medium sized schools with 90.62% overall passing rates. This makes sense as classroom sizes may be bigger thus, giving teachers less attention and time per student.\n",
